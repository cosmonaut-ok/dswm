The Deep Space Window Manager
------------------------

DSWM is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
attempts to be highly and easy customizable while relying entirely on the
keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool
bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets.

DSWM is a fork of StumpWM, so have most of all features, which have
StumpWM, but it designed for better usability and better integration with
emacs. It is an early release, so some of it`s own features may not work
or may work incorrect. In future releases we will fix it.

These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
customizable lisp based systems.

There's a texinfo manual, doc/dswm.texi. the build scripts generate an
