Porting to cl-freetype2

cl-freetype2 replaces zpb-ttf and cl-vectors dependencies. All funcalls to these packages should be replaced with similar cl-freetype2 funcalls. They include

  * font caching
      https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/clx-truetype/blob/master/font-cache.lisp#L29-L42
  * font loader
      https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/clx-truetype/blob/master/clx-truetype.lisp#L111-L120
  * font metrics
      https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/clx-truetype/blob/master/clx-truetype.lisp#L145-L184
  * symbol/string biboxing
      https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/clx-truetype/blob/master/clx-truetype.lisp#L186-L269  
  * font rasterizing
      https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/clx-truetype/blob/master/clx-truetype.lisp#L310-L499

About cl-cairo.
When I handle text drawing in stumpwm, I get clx:window (drawable surface) and clx:gcontext (graphical context) objects, which are used by clx drawing functions then.
https://github.com/sabetts/stumpwm/compare/tt-fonts#diff-7e56d08baa29d13311787486231783f2R88

Unfortunately cl-cairo2 drawing functions can't take clx:window and clx:gcontext objects. It uses internal c structures from cairo c library. So, I don't know how to port drawing functions from clx to cl-cairo in stumpwm space.

I've done it 2 years ago:
https://github.com/daimrod/Stumpwm/blob/master/stumpwm.asd

I believe setting GDK_CORE_DEVICE_EVENTS=1 fixes this. Not sure what
costs it might have. I used it to fix mouse wheel scrolling in
transmission-gtk.
