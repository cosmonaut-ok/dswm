The Deep Space Window Manager
------------------------

DSWM is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
attempts to be highly and easy customizable while relying entirely on the
keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool
bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets.

DSWM is a fork of StumpWM, so have most of all features, which have
StumpWM, but it designed for better usability and better integration with
emacs. It is an early release, so some of it`s own features may not work
or may work incorrect. In future releases we will fix it.

These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
customizable lisp based systems.

Build & Start DSWM
---------------------

Prerequisites
=============

* a common lisp distribution. Now, officially supports only SBCL.
* clx
* cl-ppcre

You can use asdf-install to install lisp libraries:
  $ sbcl
    * (require 'asdf)
    * (require 'asdf-install)
    * (asdf-install:install 'clx)
    * (asdf-install:install 'cl-ppcre)

Or, using quicklisp:
  $ sbcl
    * (ql:quickload "clx")
    * (ql:quickload "cl-ppcre")

NOTE: ensure, that it is already installed and loads automatically into SBCL
You can get quicklisp from official site: http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/

Your operating system distribution may also have these libraries
available.

Building
========

Building dswm from GIT requires that you build the configure script:

$ autoconf

If there's already a configure script then just run it.

$ ./configure

If your SBCL is in strange places you may need to tell the script where to find them:

$ configure --with-sbcl=/home/sabetts/opt/bin/sbcl

Now build it:

$ make

If all goes well, you should have a dswm binary now. If autoconf 
worked properly, you can install the binary, along with the .info
documentation with:

$ make install

Now that you have a binary, call it from your ~/.xinitrc file:

$ echo exec /path/to/dswm >> ~/.xinitrc
$ startx

Also, if you use display manager (like GDM or some other), can login
using it (DSWM puts dswm.desktop to xsessions path)

Hopefully that will put you in X running dswm!

SBCL And Threads
----------------

SBCL compiled with threads causes problems with dswm. The most
common is sluggishness. It may also cause dswm to become
unresponsive. If you use SBCL, consider using a version built without
threads.

Help
----

There's a texinfo manual, dswm.texi. the build scripts generate an
info file you can read in emacs or with the `info' program.

For other stuff visit the dswm wiki:

But, as it's not properly completed now, you can also visit stumpwm wiki too:

Also, you can visit to #dswm channel on irc.freenoode.net for issues directly related to dswm

Mailing lists: dswm-user@lists.sourceforge.net and dswm-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
