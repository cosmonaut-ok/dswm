@node Starting DSWM, Basic Usage, Introduction, Introduction
@section Starting DSWM
There are a number of ways to start DSWM but the most straight
forward method is as follows. This assumes you have a copy of the
DSWM source code and are using the @samp{SBCL} Common Lisp
environment.

@enumerate
@item
Install @command{sbcl}, the @command{portable-clx} package, and
@command{cl-ppcre}. In Debian, @command{portable-clx} is the
@command{cl-clx-sbcl} package. You can also use @command{asdf-install} to
download and install@tie{}@command{clx}:

@example
$ sbcl
* (require :asdf)
* (require :asdf-install)
* (asdf-install:install :clx)
* (asdf-install:install :cl-ppcre)
@end example

Note that @command{asdf-install} requires @command{gnupg}.

@item
In the @file{dswm} directory, run @command{./configure}.

@item
run @command{make}. If all goes well,
this should create a @file{dswm} executable.

@item
In your @file{~/.xinitrc} file include the line
@command{/path/to/dswm}. Remember to replace @samp{/path/to/}
with the actual path.

@item
Finally, start X windows with @command{startx}. Cross your
fingers. You should see a @samp{Welcome To the Deep Space Window Manager}
message pop up in the upper, right corner. At this point, you have
successfully started DSWM.
@end enumerate

@node Basic Usage, Interacting with the Lisp process, Starting DSWM, Introduction
@section Some definitions
In this manual we will use some special definitions:

@subsection Key sequences
@kbd{PREF} - means prefix keyboard sequence. It is @kbd{Control + j} by default
@kbd{C-k}  - means, that you have to press keys ``Control'' and ``k'' at one time
@kbd{M-k}  - means, that you have to press keys ``Alt and ``k'' at one time
@kbd{S-k}  - means, that you have to press keys ``Shift'' and ``k'' at one time
@kbd{C-K}  - means, that you have to press keys ``Control'', ``Shift'' and ``k'' at one time
@kbd{s-k}  - means, that you have to press keys ``Windows''-key (``super'') and ``k'' at one time
@kbd{PREF g k}  - means, that you have to press prefix key sequence, then press ``g'' and then press ``k''

@section Basic Usage
Once you have DSWM up and running, the first thing you might want
to do is start @command{emacs}. Type @kbd{PREF e}, or in other words
@kbd{Control + j} followed by @kbd{e}. Now perhaps you want an
@command{xterm}. Type @kbd{PREF c}. Now you have some programs running.

To see a list of windows DSWM is managing, type @kbd{PREF w}. The
highlighted window is the one you're looking at right now. It's the
focused window.

All of DSWM's keys are bound to named commands, which can be
executed not only by keys but also from the input bar. Type @kbd{PREF
;} to open a command prompt. Now type @command{time} and press
return. Note, @command{time} can also be called by typing @kbd{PREF a}.
Throughout this manual you'll find definitions for commands,
functions, and variables. Any command you see in this manual can be
executed from the input bar or bound to a key.

At this point you probably want to switch back from your new
@command{xterm} to @command{emacs}. Type @kbd{PREF PREF}. This runs the
@command{other} command. Type it again and you're back to xterm.

Perhaps you'd like to see @command{emacs} and @command{xterm}
side-by-side. Type @kbd{PREF s}. You have now split the screen into 2
@command{frames}. For more information see @ref{Frames}. To switch to the
empty frame type @kbd{PREF TAB}. Now let's pull the xterm window into
this empty frame. Type @kbd{PREF w} for a window listing. Find the
@command{xterm} window. See the number beside it? Type @kbd{PREF} followed
by @command{xterm}'s window number.

Another common activity is browsing the interwebs. Type @kbd{PREF !}.
The input bar pops up again. You can now run a shell command.  Let's
start a web browser: type @command{firefox} into the input bar and press
return.

Unfortunately, @command{firefox} probably isn't wide enough because it's
in one of the frames. Type @kbd{PREF Q} to remove all frames but the
current one and resize it to fit the screen.

For a full list of key bindings, see @ref{List of Default Keybindings}.

@node Interacting with the Lisp process, Contact the DSWM developers, Basic Usage, Introduction
@section Interacting with the Lisp process

Since DSWM is a Lisp program, there is a way for you to evaluate
Lisp code directly, on the same Lisp process that DSWM is running on.
Type @kbd{PREF :} and an input box will appear. Then type some Lisp
expression.

When you call @command{eval} this way, you will be in the DSWM-USER
package, which imports all the exported symbols from the main DSWM
package.

@table @code
@item *mode-line-border-width*
Reads the value of @var{*mode-line-border-width*}.

@item (setf *mode-line-border-width* 3)
Sets the variable @var{*mode-line-border-width*} to 3.

@item (set-prefix-key (kbd "C-M-H-s-z"))
Calls the @code{set-prefix-key} function (and sets a new keyboard prefix)

@item PREF C-@var{d}
Pull the window with the corresponding digit@tie{}@var{d} into the current frame

@item PREF n
@itemx PREF C-n
@itemx PREF Space
Go to the next window in the window list

@item PREF p
@itemx PREF C-p
Go to the previous window in the window list

@item PREF '
Go to a window by name

@item PREF "
Select a window from a list and focus the window.

@item PREF C-g
Abort the current command. This is useful if you accidentally hit @kbd{PREF}

@item PREF w
List all the windows

@item PREF i
Display information about the current window.

@item PREF f
Select a frame by number

@item PREF s
Split current frame vertically

@item PREF S

Sends a kill message to the current frame and the running program.

@item PREF K
Kills the current frame and running program; like a @command{kill -9}.

@item PREF c
@itemx PREF C-c
Run an X terminal; by default @command{xterm}

@item PREF e
@itemx PREF C-e
Run Emacs or raise it if it is already running.

@item PREF t
Sends a @kbd{PREF} to the frame; this is useful for applications like Firefox
which make heavy use of @kbd{PREF} (in Firefox's case, for opening a new
tab). This is similar to how GNU screen uses @kbd{C-a a}.

@item PREF w
@itemx PREF C-w
Prints out a list of the windows, their number, and their name.

@item PREF b
@itemx PREF C-b
Runs your default browser.

@item PREF a
@itemx PREF C-a
Display the current time and date, much like the Unix command @command{date}.

@item PREF PREF
Switch to the last window to have focus in the current frame.

@item PREF !
Prompt for a shell command to run via @file{/bin/sh}. All output is discarded.

@item PREF R
If the screen is split into multiple frames, one split will be
undone. If there is only one split, the effect will be the same as @kbd{PREF Q}.

@item PREF o
@itemx PREF TAB
If the screen is split into multiple frames, focus shifts to the
@command{next} frame, where it cycles to the right and then down; analogous
to @kbd{C-x o} in Emacs.

@item PREF F
Display ``Current Frame'' in the frame which has focus.

@item PREF ;
Opens the input box. DSWM commands can be run from here, and the
input history moved through.

@item PREF :
Opens the input box, but all things typed in here will be sent to the
Common Lisp interpreter where they will be ran as Lisp programs; thus,
input should be valid Common Lisp.

@item PREF C-h
The short help and basic DSWM information about system and default directories.
@item PREF ?
The help.

@item PREF -
Hide all frames and show the root window.

@item PREF Q
Removes all splits and maximizes the frame with focus.

@item PREF Up
@itemx PREF Down
@itemx PREF Left
@itemx PREF Right

shift focus up, if possible, @kbd{PREF Down} will shift downwards, etc.

@item PREF v
Prints out the version of the running DSWM.

@item PREF #
Toggle the mark on the current window

@item PREF m
@itemx PREF C-m
Display the last message. Hitting this keybinding again displays the
message before that, and so on.

@section Modifiers

Many users have had some difficulty with setting up modifiers for
DSWM keybindings. This is caused by a combination of how DSWM
handles modifiers and the default modifiers list for many users' X
servers.

@itemize

@item
My ``Super'' key doesn't work!

This is most likely caused by having the Hyper and Super keys listed
as the same modifier in the modifier list.

@example
$ xmodmap
xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71),  Meta_L (0x9c)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3
mod4        Super_L (0x7f),  Hyper_L (0x80)
mod5        Mode_switch (0x5d),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x7c)
@end example

The problem is in the line beginning with ``mod4''. The way to set up
the modifier list correctly is to have just the Super key as the mod4
modifier. The following @command{xmodmap} commands will do just that.

@example
# clear out the mod4 modifier
$ xmodmap -e 'clear mod4'
$ xmodmap
xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71),  Meta_L (0x9c)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3
mod4
mod5        Mode_switch (0x5d),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x7c)

# add Super as a mod4 modifier
$ xmodmap -e 'add mod4 = Super_L'
$ xmodmap
xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71),  Meta_L (0x9c)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3
mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_L (0x7f)
mod5        Mode_switch (0x5d),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x7c)
@end example

You can automate this by storing the commands in a file and calling
xmodmap when you start your X session.

@example
$ cat ~/.Xmodmap
clear mod4
add mod4 = Super_L
@end example

If you use @command{startx}, modify your @file{~/.xsession} or @file{~/.xinitrc} file.

@example
$ cat ~/.xsession
#!/bin/sh

xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
exec /usr/bin/dswm
@end example

If you use a graphical login manager (GDM, KDM, etc.), your @file{~/.Xmodmap}
file should be fed to @command{xmodmap} when you log in. FIXME: verify this.

@item
Handling Meta and Alt: when do I use @kbd{M-} and @kbd{A-}?

If you have no Meta keys defined (see the output of the @command{xmodmap}
command), then DSWM will treat the @kbd{M-} prefix in keybindings to
mean Alt. However, if there are Meta keys defined, then the @kbd{M-}
prefix refers to them, and the @kbd{A-} prefix refers to Alt.

Most users will simply use @kbd{M-} to refer to their Alt keys. However,
users that define separate Meta and Alt keys will use @kbd{M-} to refer
to the former, and @kbd{A-} to refer to the latter.

@item
How can I set up a Hyper key and use it with DSWM?

To set up a Hyper key, you need to do two things: bind a physical key
to be a Hyper key, and add that key to the modifiers list.

The following example shows how to bind the control key at the
bottom-left of most keyboards to be Hyper. This is useful if you've
made Caps Lock into a control key, and have no use for the bottom-left
key.

@example
$ xmodmap -e 'keycode 37 = Hyper_L'
$ xmodmap -e 'clear mod5'
$ xmodmap -e 'add mod5 = Hyper_L'
@end example

To use a different key for Hyper, replace the keycode ``37'' above.
Use the @command{xev} program to see the keycode that any physical key has.
Refer to the section above on setting up the Super key to see how to
automate setting the Hyper key when you start X.

Now you can use @kbd{H-} as a prefix in DSWM bindings.

@example
(define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-RET") "fullscreen")
(define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-Left") "gprev")
(define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-Right") "gnext")
(define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-TAB") "other")
@end example

Since essentially no programs have Hyper bindings, you can safely bind
commands to the @var{*top-map*}.

@end itemize

@node Commands, Message and Input Bar, Key Bindings, Top
@chapter Commands
If you've used emacs before you'll find commands and functions
familiar. Commands are functions that can be bound to keys and
executed interactively from DSWM's input bar. A command expects a
certain number of arguments and any that are not supplied will be
prompted for.

@section Controlling Raise And Map Requests
It is sometimes handy to deny a window's request to be focused. The
following variables determine such behavior.

A map request occurs when a new or withdrawn window requests to be
mapped for the first time.

A raise request occurs when a client asks the window manager to give
an existing window focus.

### *deny-map-request*
### *deny-raise-request*
### *suppress-deny-messages*

Some examples follow.

@example
;; Deny the firefox window from taking focus when clicked upon.
(push '(:class "gecko") dswm:*deny-raise-request*)

;; Deny all map requests
(setf dswm:*deny-map-request* t)

;; Deny transient raise requests
(push '(:transient) dswm:*deny-map-request*)

;; Deny the all windows in the xterm class from taking focus.
(push '(:class "Xterm") dswm:*deny-raise-request*)

@node Mode-line, Groups, Frames, Top
@chapter The Mode Line
The mode line is a bar that runs across either the top or bottom of
a head and is used to display information. By default the mode line
displays the list of windows, similar to the output @kbd{PREF w} produces.

Alternatively, external panel applications such as the GNOME panel and
KDE's kicker may be used. Simply starting one of these programs is enough
to set it as the mode line of the head it would like to be on (if the
panel is Xinerama aware) or whichever head is available. In order to
avoid problems displaying menus, configure your panel application for
positioning at the top or bottom of the head rather than relying on
@var{*mode-line-position*}

The mode line can be turned on and off with the @command{mode-line}
command or the lisp function @code{dswm:toggle-mode-line}. Each
head has its own mode line. For example:

@example
;; turn on/off the mode line for the current head only.
(dswm:toggle-mode-line (dswm:current-screen)
                          (dswm:current-head))
@end example

The mode line is updated after every DSWM command.

To display the window list and the current date on the modeline, one
might do the following:

@example
(setf dswm:*screen-mode-line-format*
      (list "%w | "
            '(:eval (dswm:run-shell-command "date" t))))
@end example

@code{(dswm:run-shell-command "date" t)} runs the command
@command{date} and returns its output as a string.

character and apply to all text after it.

@table @code
@item ^0-9
A caret followed by a single digit number changes the foreground color
to the specified color. A @samp{*} can be used to specify the normal
color. See the color listing below.

@item ^0-90-9
A caret followed by two digits sets the foreground and background
color. The first digit refers to the foreground color and the second
digit to the background color. A @samp{*} can be used in place of
either digit to specify the normal color. See the color listing below.

@item ^B
Turn on bright colors.

@item ^b
Turn off bright colors.

@item ^n
Use the normal background and foreground color.

@item ^R
Reverse the foreground and background colors.

@item ^r
Turn off reverse colors.

@item ^[
Push the current colors onto the color stack. The current colors remain unchanged.

@item ^]
Pop the colors off the color stack.

@item ^^

@node General Advice, Using git with DSWM, Hacking, Hacking
@section Hacking:  General Advice

@enumerate

@item
Pay attention to file names and contents. If you're making changes to
mode-line related code, don't put it in @file{core.lisp}. If you're
introducing some completely new featureset, consider putting all of
the new code in a new file.

@item
Does a command need to be user-visible (``interactive'') or is it just
called by other commands?

@itemize
@item
If it's not going to be user-visible, you can just use the familiar
@code{(defun foo () ...)} syntax.

@item
If you want the command to be used interactively, you use DSWM's
@code{defcommand} syntax, as in the examples below.

@example
(defcommand test (foo bar)
   ((:string "How you're going to prompt for variable foo: ")
    (:number "How you want to prompt for variable bar: "))
   "This command is a test"
   (body...))

(defcommand test2 () ()
   "This is also a test"
   (body...))

(defcommand title (args) (interactive-args)
   "Doc string"
   (body...))
@end example

So basically, inside the first set of parentheses after the
function name, you specify what (if any) arguments will be passed to
the command. The second set of parentheses tells DSWM how to get
those arguments if they're not explicitly passed to the command. For
example,

@example
((:string "What do you want to do: "))
@end example

will read a string from the input the user provides. The quoted
text is the prompt the user will see. Of course, if you were to, say,
call the command test, as defined above, from another piece of code,
it wouldn't give the prompt as long as you fed it arguments.
@end itemize

@item
Note that all commands defined using the @code{defcommand} syntax are
available both to be called with @kbd{PREF ;} and from within other lisp
programs, as though they had been defun-ned (which, in fact, they
have).

@item
Any code that depends on external libraries or programs that some
users might not have installed should be placed in the @file{contrib/}
directory.

@item
Don't be afraid to submit your patches to the DSWM mailing list!
It may not immediately make it into the official git repository, but
individual users might find it useful and apply it to their own setup,
or might be willing to offer suggestions on how to improve the code.

@item
Remember:  DSWM is designed to run on both clisp and on SBCL. If
you must use code specific to one or the other, at the very least warn
people that it only works with one lisp implementation. Better yet,
figure out how to do it in the other distribution and write a
statement like this:

@example
#+clisp
(your-clisp-code)
#+sbcl
(your-sbcl-code)
@end example

#to wrap the code for each lisp. Of course, the best option is to
find a way to use the same code for clisp and SBCL.
@end enumerate

@node Using git with DSWM, Sending Patches, General Advice, Hacking
@section Hacking:  Using git with DSWM

For quite a while now, DSWM has been using the git version control
system for development. If you're one using one of the official
releases or still using the now-obsolete CVS version, you can get the
bleeding-edge source code from the official git repository with
a single command:

@example
$ git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/dswm.git
@end example

After this, you'll have a complete git repository, along with the
complete revision history since the switch. Feel free to play around;
git has some important features that actually make this safe!

Before we get to that stuff, though, you're going to want to tell git
about yourself so that your information is included in your commits
and patches. The very minimum you're going to want to do is:

@example
$ git config --global user.name "Anne N. O'Nymous"
$ git config --global user.email "anonymous@@foo.org"
@end example

Be sure to check out the manual for @command{git-config}--there are several
options you might want to set, such as enabling colorized output or
changing the editor and pager you use when making commits and viewing
logs.

For the sake of argument, let's say you want to make some major
changes to both @file{user.lisp} and @file{core.lisp}, add a file called
@file{DANGEROUS_EXPERIMENT_DO_NOT_USE_OR_@-ELSE.lisp}, and remove the manual
because you're too 1337 for such things. However, you don't want to
break your entire DSWM setup and start over. Thankfully, you don't
have to. Before you get started, issue this command from the dswm
directory:

@example
$ git checkout -b experimental
@end example

You should now find yourself in a new branch, called experimental. To
confirm this, type @command{git branch}; there should be
an asterisk next to the branch you're currently viewing. At any time,
you can type @command{git checkout master} to return to your master branch,
and at any time you can have as many branches of the project as you
like. If you want to create a new branch based not on the master
branch but on your experimental branch, for example, you'd type:

@example
$ git checkout -b new-experiment experimental
@end example

This will place you in a newly-created branch called ``new-experiment''
which should be identical to your experimental branch as of the last
commit (more on that soon). If you're actually typing out the
directions, switch back to your old experimental branch like so:

@example
$ git checkout experimental
@end example

Anyway, now that you have a new branch, create that new file with the
long name, which I'll just call @file{danger.lisp} for brevity. Make whatever
changes you want to it, and when you're done, tell git about your new
file.

@example
$ git add dangerous.lisp
@end example

Now, let's pretend you're done making changes. Tell git you're done
for now:

@example
$ git commit -a
@end example

This will open up a prompt in your editor of choice for you to
describe your changes. Try to keep the first line short, and then add
more explanation underneath (for an example, run the command @command{git log}
and take a look at some of the longer commit explanations). Save that
file and then do this:

@example
$ git checkout master
$ ls
@end example

Then look for your new file. It's not there! That's because you've
done all of your work in another branch, which git is currently hiding
from you so that you can ``check out'' the branch called ``master.'' All
is as it should be--your master repository is still safe.

@example
$ git checkout experimental
@end example

Now, delete @file{manual.lisp} and @file{dswm.texi}. That's right. Wipe them off
the face of the Earth, or at least off the hard drive of your
computer. When you're done, you don't have to tell git you've deleted
them; it'll figure it out on its own (though things may not compile
properly unless you edit @file{Makefile.in} and @file{dswm.asd}. Anyway, go ahead
and edit @file{core.lisp} and @file{user.lisp}. Really break 'em. Run free! When
you're done, do another commit, as above, and give it a stupid title
like ``lolz i b0rked stUmpwm guys wTF!?!?!!111!'' Now try to compile.
Just try. It won't work. If it does, you're some kind of savant or
something. Keep up the good work. If you've actually managed to break
DSWM like you were supposed to, never fear! You have two options at
this point.

One is to go back to the master branch (with another git checkout) and
just delete your experimental branch, like so:

@example
$ git branch -D
@end example

The ``@code{-D}'' means to force a delete, even if the changes you've made
aren't available elsewhere. A ``@code{-d}'' means to delete the branch if and
only if you've merged the changes in elsewhere.

The other option is to create patches for each of your commits so far,
delete the branch, and then apply any working/wanted patches in a new
branch. Create your patches (after committing) like so:

@example
$ git format-patch -o patches origin
@end example

(Before doing that you can review your changes with @command{git log origin..})

You can also use the @command{format-patch} command to create a patch of working
code to send in to the mailing list.

A developer might ask you to try out something they're working on. To
fetch their master branch, you'd do this:

@example
$ git remote add -f -m master -t master foo git://bar.org/~foo/dswm
@end example

Here, ``foo'' is the shorthand name you'll use to refer to that
repository in the future. To checkout a local copy of that repository,
you'd then do

@example
$ git checkout --track -b foo-master foo/master
@end example

Later you could use @command{git pull foo} to update while looking at that
branch (and note that @command{git pull} with no arguments, in the master
branch, will update your DSWM from the official repository).

Finally, if you want to move your experimental changes into your
master branch, you'd checkout your master branch and run:

@example
$ git merge experimental
@end example

If there are file conflicts, @command{git diff} will show you where they are;
you have to fix them by hand. When you're done, do another

@example
$ git commit -a
@end example

to finalize the changes to your master branch. You can then delete
your experimental branch. Alternately, you can wait until your changes
(assuming you sent them in) make it into the official repository
before deleting your experimental branch.

@node Sending Patches,  , Using git with DSWM, Hacking
@section Sending Patches
When sending patches to the mailing list for inclusion in DSWM,
there are a few guidelines that will make everything go smoother.

@itemize
@item
Make sure it applies clean to the main git repository

@item
Ensure that you aren't introducing tabs, extra blank lines, or whitespace at the end of lines.

@item
Ensure your patch doesn't contain irrelevant indenting or reformatting changes.

@item
Try to make your patch address a single issue. If your patch changes
two unrelated issues, break them into two seperate patches that can
stand on their own.

@item
Don't send intermediate patches. When you're working on a feature you
might make several commits to your local repository as you refine it
and work out the bugs. When it's polished and ready to ship, send it
as one patch! Sometimes it makes sense to send it as multiple patches
if each patch contains a discrete feature or bug fix that can stand on
its own. If one of your patches changes code that was added or
modified in an earlier patch, consider merging them together and
sending them as one.
