The Deep Space Window Manager
------------------------

DSWM is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
attempts to be highly and easy customizable while relying entirely on the
keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool
bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets.

DSWM is a fork of StumpWM, so it has most of the features that StumpWM
has, but it is designed for better usability and better integration with
emacs. It is an early release under active development, so some of its
own features may not work or may not work correctly. In future releases
we will fix it.

These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
customizable lisp based systems.

To build, install, start and basic DSWM usage see the doc/README file

There's a texinfo manual, doc/dswm.texi. The build scripts generate an
info file that you can read in emacs or with the `info' program.
