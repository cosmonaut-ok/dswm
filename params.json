It\r\nattempts to be highly and easy customizable while relying entirely on the\r\nkeyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool\r\nbars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets.\r\n\r\nDSWM is a fork of StumpWM, so have most of all features, which have\r\nStumpWM, but it designed for better usability and better integration with\r\nemacs. It is an early release, so some of it`s own features may not work\r\nor may work incorrect. In future releases we will fix it.\r\n\r\nThese design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,\r\ncustomizable lisp based systems.\r\n\r\nBuild & Start DSWM\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n=============\r\n\r\n* a common lisp distribution. Now, officially supports only SBCL.\r\n* clx\r\n* cl-ppcre\r\n\r\nYou can use asdf-install to install lisp libraries:\r\n  $ sbcl\r\n    * (require 'asdf)\r\n    * (require 'asdf-install)\r\n    * (asdf-install:install 'clx)\r\n    * (asdf-install:install 'cl-ppcre)\r\n\r\nOr, using quicklisp:\r\n  $ sbcl\r\n    * (ql:quickload \"clx\")\r\n    * (ql:quickload \"cl-ppcre\")\r\n\r\nNOTE: ensure, that it is already installed and loads automatically into SBCL\r\nYou can get quicklisp from official site: http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/\r\n\r\nYour operating system distribution may also have these libraries\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n========\r\n\r\nBuilding dswm from GIT requires that you build the configure script:\r\n\r\n$ autoconf\r\n\r\nIf there's already a configure script then just run it.\r\n\r\n$ ./configure\r\n\r\nIf your SBCL is in strange places you may need to tell the script where to find them:\r\n\r\n$ configure --with-sbcl=/home/sabetts/opt/bin/sbcl\r\n\r\nNow build it:\r\n\r\n$ make\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, you should have a dswm binary now. If autoconf \r\nworked properly, you can install the binary, along with the .info\r\ndocumentation with:\r\n\r\n$ make install\r\n\r\nNow that you have a binary, call it from your ~/.xinitrc file:\r\n\r\n$ echo exec /path/to/dswm >> ~/.xinitrc\r\n$ startx\r\n\r\nAlso, if you use display manager (like GDM or some other), can login\r\nusing it (DSWM puts dswm.desktop to xsessions path)\r\n\r\nHopefully that will put you in X running dswm!\r\n\r\nSBCL And Threads\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nSBCL compiled with threads causes problems with dswm. The most\r\ncommon is sluggishness. It may also cause dswm to become\r\nunresponsive. If you use SBCL, consider using a version built without\r\nthreads.\r\n\r\nHelp\r\n----\r\n\r\nThere's a texinfo manual, dswm.texi. the build scripts generate an\r\ninfo file you can read in emacs or with the `info' program.\r\n\r\nFor other stuff visit the dswm wiki:\r\nhttp://wiki.dss-project.org/doku.php/en:index\r\n\r\nBut, as it's not properly completed now, you can also visit stumpwm wiki too:\r\nhttps://github.com/sabetts/stumpwm/wiki/\r\n\r\nAlso, you can visit to #dswm channel on irc.freenoode.net for issues directly related to dswm\r\n\r\nMailing lists: dswm-user@lists.sourceforge.net and dswm-devel@lists.sourceforge.net\r\n\r\nFinally, you can see the DSWM news on official site\r\nhttp://dss-project.org/\r\nor read some useful information on DSWM blog\r\nenglish: http://dss-project.blogspot.com/\r\nrussian: http://dss-project-ru.blogspot.com/\r\nukrainian: http://dss-project-uk.blogspot.com/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
