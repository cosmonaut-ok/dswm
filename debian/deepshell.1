.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dsish
.RI [[-e]
.I command
.RI [args...]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
DSISH is the DSWM shell.  Use it to interact a running DSWM
instance.
.PP
When run from a terminal with no arguments, \fBdsish\fP accepts
commands interactively and prints each result.
.PP
If standard input is a pipe, \fBdsish\fP executes any number of
commands and prints the concatenated results.
.PP
If the '\-e' option and one argument are given on the command line,
dsish reads any number of lines from standard input and uses them
as the argument to the named command.  Otherwise, if one or more
arguments are provided on the command line, the first is considered
the name of the command to execute and the remainder is concatenated
to form the argument.
