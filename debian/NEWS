dswm (1:20110419.gitb80ff16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Lisp implementations no longer include ASDF in their images.  SBCL has
  its bundled ASDF but CLISP not.  To use ASDF in CLISP, user has to
  install cl-asdf.  From this release, dswm recommends cl-asdf.

  Note that it's unnecessary to manually load ASDF before running
  /usr/bin/dswm.  DSwm can take care of it.

  Finally, with this release a binary /usr/bin/dswm is provided
  (thus solving the long-standing bug #356948).

  By default /usr/bin/dswm tries to load DSWM via SBCL, but it
  supports CMUCL and CLisp, too, /usr/share/doc/dswm/README.Debian
  contains the necessary information.

  Some changes have been introduced in the ~/.dswmrc file.

  The *prefix-key* is configured as following:
    (set-prefix-key (kbd "[KEY]"))

  The `set-key-binding' function is no longer available and keybindings
  are defined as following:
    (define-key [MAP] (kbd "[KEY]") "[ACTION]")

  Check the /usr/share/doc/dswm/examples/sample-dswmrc.lisp for
  some examples.
